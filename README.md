# To-Vote-or-Not-to-Vote

## Inspiration
As first-year university students, we recently experienced our first opportunity to vote in the 2022 election. The process of registering, researching candidates, and going to the polls was new and daunting for many of us. However, with the support of various programs within our communities, our voting experience was made smoother and more successful. Through this data analysis project, we aim to not only gain a deeper understanding of our communities' efforts to increase voter turnout, but also to identify potential areas for improvement and develop creative solutions to increase voter engagement and efficiency.
## What it does
Our project analyzes voting data and finds inefficiencies and ways to increase efficiencies in the allocation of Get Out to Vote resources.
## How we built it
Our data analysis was done in a Juypter Notebook file. Using the data provided by Baker Ripley and web scraping for more data from voter websites, we used tools like python Pandas and Numpy to analyze and create a story about the 2022 election in Harris County.
## Challenges we ran into
In our analysis, we ran into a lot of missing or misentered data, which we had to interpret and properly deal with. Additionally, many of the data sets we found or were given had large sizes, which significantly slowed down our computation speeds. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Every aspect of this type of data analysis is new to us, so firstly getting the chance to learn and have a finished project with so little knowledge is awesome. Some specifics we are proud of are our visualizations(specifically our map!),  web scraping for more data, and learning statistical analysis skills.
## What we learned
We learned about many python data analysis tools
## What's next for Voting Analysis of Harris County, Texas
Hopefully, our input into Baker Ripley's Get Out to Vote Campaign will help make the process even more efficient and some of our inputs more focused.
